# Simulation-Analysis

Consider a modifieed TTF system that works as follows.
Âˆ There are three components (one active, two spares, but sill only one can be repaired at a time); repair time is 3.5 days.

Created the Python simulation code for the modified TTF system described, ran 100 replications, and record the time of system failure, denoted by Y1; Y2; : : : ; Y100, and the average number of functional component, denoted by  S1;  S2; : : : ;  S100. Then, calculated the 95% confident intervals for expected time of system failure and average number of functional component.
