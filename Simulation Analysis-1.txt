Consider a modified TTF system that works as follows. 

ÂˆThere are three components (one active, two spares, but sill only one can be
repaired at a time); repair time is 3.5 days.

Based on the TTF Python code, I created the Python simulation code for the
modified TTF system described, ran 100 replications, and recorded
the time of system failure, denoted by Y1; Y2; : : : ; Y100, and the average number
of functional component, denoted by S1; S2; : : : ; S100. Then, calculated the 95%
confidence intervals for expected time of system failure and average number of
functional component.
